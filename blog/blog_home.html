		<h1>Our Relationship With Food</h1>
		<p>
			Food. When you hear that word I want you to think about the thoughts and images that your mind conjures up. Maybe it'll conjure up images of a cheesburger, or a slice of pizza. Maybe your mind will conjure up images of a candy bar, or just about anything that is edible. For me, it's fresh veggies and produce. Ingredients that can be harvested from a farm or purchased at a local market, or freshly cut meat often seen at a butcher's shop. We need food to survive and sustain ourselves, but sometimes we eat food for the sake of pleasure. Hence the existence of fine dining restaurants. Places where delicious cuisine is developed for the sake of the sake of those who enjoy(and those who can afford it) amzing unique flavors. There also exists fast food chains such as McDonalds, or fast casual chains such as Dig. Two companies which are on two opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to healthy food and unhealthy food.
