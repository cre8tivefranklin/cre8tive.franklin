		<h1>Our Relationship With Food</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Food</strong>. When you hear that word I want you to think about the thoughts and images that your mind conjures up. Maybe it'll conjure up images of a cheesburger, or thoughts of pizza. Maybe your mind will conjure up images of a candy bar, or just thoughts of anything that is edible. For me, it's fresh veggies and produce. Ingredients that can be harvested from a farm or purchased at a local market, or freshly cut meat often seen at a butcher's shop. We need food to survive and sustain ourselves, but sometimes we eat food for the sheer pleasure. Hence the existence of fine dining restaurants. Places where delicious cuisine is developed for the sake of those who enjoy(and those who can afford) amazing and unique flavors. There also exists fast food chains such as McDonalds, or fast casual chains such as Dig. Two companies that are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to healthy food and unhealthy food.

				<h1>A fun food exeperiment</h1>
				<p>
					I bought fresh ingredients from the local market in my neighborhood and managed to cook this up. It was an appetizing meal to say the least, but observing how veggies can change under certain conditions is what fascinated me the most. Such as watching the way the cauliflower cooked after marinating it. Or tasting the poblano pepper while it was raw and then seeing how the flavor changed after it was baked and broiled. I cannot forget to mention the chicken breast as well. Seeing the maillard reaction occur as it sears on each side. Carefully observing the chicken's temperature in order to prevent it from overcooking. All so that the chicken can have a soft and tender texture as well as a juicy flavor. Moving forward, I would like to share what I observed about these specific veggies, and what I had found to be of interest.
