	<h1>Our Relationship With Food</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Food</strong>. When you hear that word I want you to think about the thoughts and images that your mind conjures up. Maybe it'll conjure up images of a cheesburger, or thoughts of pizza. Maybe your mind will conjure up images of a candy bar, or just thoughts of anything that is edible. For me, it's fresh veggies and produce. Ingredients that can be harvested from a farm or purchased at a local market, or freshly cut meat often seen at a butcher's shop. We need food to survive and sustain ourselves, but sometimes we eat food for the sheer pleasure. Hence the existence of fine dining restaurants. Places where delicious cuisine is developed for the sake of those who enjoy(and those who can afford) amazing and unique flavors. There also exists fast food chains such as McDonalds, or fast casual chains such as Dig. Two companies that are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to healthy food and unhealthy food.

		<header>What is food... really?</header>
		<p>
			This might sound like a silly question. That being said, how often do we ask this question? One could define food as something that is consumed for our survival. Would you as a reader agree with this notion? Of course anyone would, but is food even meant to be enjoyed? There are parts of the world where people are underprivalleged. Places where people are so poor that the idea of enjoying great flavor is probably a foreign concept. Then there are places in the world where the only thing people can afford to eat is cheap and unhealthy fast food. Then there are also places such as farms where people have to work really hard to grow their own food. There is a lot of science behind food and more so than people expect or think about. After all, plant life has existed for billions of years. Long before humans came into the picture or many of the other organisms that populate this planet along side of us. Due to my own fascination with the science behind food, I have conducted several food experiments so to speak, and have many more planned out for the near future as well. I have written observartions on how certain veggies behave when exposed to various oils, spices, or cooking conditions. I have even contemplated getting a microscope to observe food at the microscopic level. There is also a book that I have been reading that is centered on the essentials of food science. With all of this being said, I even became a chef so that I could see food science in action in a professional environment. Moving on, what does all of this mean? What is our relationship with food?

		<header>Clearly, the relationship that humans have with food varies significantly.</header>
		<p>
			 Needless to say, my relationship with food has become more a more scientific one. Before, it was a relationship that was based on enjoyment and necessity. I enjoy strong flavors, so when I cook my own food I have a tendency to use ingredients like lemon juice, salt, or spicy peppers. Or if I am really hungry, I think less about my preference for flavor and eat what ever I can. If we take starvation out of the equation, you as a reader are probably not the same. Maybe you enjoy softer flavors and may even have a bit of a sweet tooth. Let us also think about humanity's relationship with food on a cultural aspect. We can see that food preferences do not just vary between individuals but between cultures as well. For example, Mexican cuisine is often spicy, indicating that in Mexican culture there exists a preference for spicy food. North American cuisine like steak with mashed potatoes, often have a more savory flavor am I correct? This indicates what flavors North Americans have a preference for. However, North America is a melting pot where cuisines from all cultures often merge, so who can really define what North Americans have a preference for? Then, let us take this segmentation even further and break it down to the cities, towns, and villages that these nations consist of. There exists even more variety for food preference between smaller communities and the relationship that such communities have with the food that they consume. In a city, ingredients are not often sourced in the same manner in which they are in a small rural community. In a city like New York, everything is grab and go and ingredients are often sourced from a purveyor. Due to the fast paced life style that is commonly associated with New York, it would be safe to assume that the majority of the people there have a relationship with food that is mostly dominated by necessity. Of course, I'm speaking for what it is like in New York during the day. At night time it's the total opposite.

		<header>Can the microbiological structure of food influence our relationship with it?</header>
		<p>
			 This sounds like a tough question for those who are not familiar with food microbiology. Frankly speaking, this is a question that I can't answer without giving strong and extensive scientific proof(which I will do as I continue to post on my blog). However, the short answer from me would be a definite yes. In our bodies there exists a community of microbes that literally train our immune systems. This community of microbes is known as the microbiome and it may have opened up an entirely new field of science according to a friend of mine in the scientific community. The microbes in our microbiome can come from the food that we eat. Have you ever noticed that those who eat a lot of junk food often have a craving for it(hungry or not)? The microbes that enter the microbiome after consumptiom are what create that craving. 80% of our immune system is located in our intestines. Regulalry consuming the wrong microbes from unhealthy food can negatively influence the microbiome and the immune system.

		<header>You are what you eat..</header>
		<p>
			We all have heard this expression at one time or another in each of our lives correct? I honestly never understood it's meaning. After learning about the existence of the microbiome, my understanding is a lot better. There are multiple ways to define our relationship with food, but the expression 'You are what you eat' is a great definition. If we follow this defnition, then it's safe to say that your very identities are shaped by everything that we've consumed thus far! If that's the case, what about our life experiences? What about the experiences that shaped the very paradigms we live by. Can the food we eat effect us to the extent that it could even influence our choice? One who takes in more serotonin often found in strawberries is likely to be a happier person that someone who eats mostly french fries. A happier person makes better choices in life.
