		<h1>A fun food experiment</h1>
		<p>
			I bought fresh ingredients from the local market in my neighborhood and managed to cook this up. <div class='meal col'></div> It was an appetizing meal to say the least, but observing how veggies can change under certain conditions is what fascinated me the most. Such as watching the way the cauliflower cooked after marinating it. Or tasting the poblano pepper while it was raw and then seeing how the flavor changed after it was baked and broiled. I cannot forget to mention the chicken breast as well. Seeing the maillard reaction occur as it sears on each side. Carefully observing the chicken's temperature in order to prevent it from overcooking. All so that the chicken can have a soft and tender texture as well as a juicy flavor. Moving forward, I would like to share what I observed about these specific veggies, and what I had found to be of interest.

			One of the most interesting things about food microbiology for me is that the pigmentation of fruits and veggies indicate the kinds of nutrients that can be found. Let us go on and take the plum tomatoes as an example. There exists mulecules within the tomatoes that are responsible for it's red pigment. These are carotenoid molecules which are also responsible for yellow and orange pigmentation as well. I have read that carotenoids are a pre-cursor to vitamin A, so this would mean that having fruits and veggies that are within the carotenoid color spectrum is ideal for those seeking to arrange a diet to improve their ocular health. When plants are 'born' they have a green pigmentation. This pigmentation changes as the plants begin to grow and age. On the contrary, there are other plants that remain green. See the poblano peppers in the image to the right? That's a pretty good example. It seems like the chlorophyl molecules(which are responsible for the green pigmentation) never decomposed as they clearly did with the plum tomatoes. That being said, the plum tomatoes had a juicier flavor than the poblano peppers. The poblano peppers on the other hand, were a little bit spicy and they also had a tougher texture, though not by a large margin of course. The tomatoes had to be cut with a serated knife. Using a regular chef knife would have caused me to squeeze the tomato too hard which would have resulted in the loss of it's juices. Unlike the poblano peppers, the tomatoes were not heated in any way. They were simply dressed with lemon juice and salt. I have heated tomatoes in the past and the result is that it becomes very soft and mush. Intrestingly enough, the flavor of the tomatoes has either weakened or strengthened. However, this difference in flavor varies between the different types tomatoes. While I'm on the subject of tomatoes, I should mention that plum tomatoes have a slightly more sour taste than a plain tomato. A plum tomato is a little harder as opposed to a plain tomato's mushy feel. With that being said, could this be because plain tomatoes spend more time ripening than plum tomatoes? When produce ripens, the cells literally grow apart from each other. This causes the produce to become softer. The flavor of a veggie that has spent significant time ripening is a lot less instense(due to being less acidic) than the flavor of a veggie that is under ripe.

		<h2>Let's talk about flavor</h2>
		<p>
			Everything you've read so far really only scratches the surface of what determines flavor in produce. I hope I was able to give a good idea as to how many variables there are when it comes to flavor. The big question that you as a reader may have is how do we find out what tastes good? Or you may be wondering how good flavors can be developed.

		<h3>The only way to know is through experimentation</h3><br>
		<p>
			With experimentation comes research as well. Whether or not you understand food microbiology, you'll see for yourself if you've spent time playing around with unfamiliar ingredients like I have. In order to go through this process of experimentation, I think it takes a sense of curiosity and adventure. As a chef, I am often told to taste what I cook. The same principle should be applied to homecooking as well. I've taken tasting to some extremes as of late. I often taste produce and various types of oils before mixing them with each other as well as before cooking them. The poblano pepper tasted a little spicier after it was heated. When it was raw, the spiciness of the poblano pepper was much less potent. <strong>Taste, taste, taste.</strong> Rely on your taste buds in order to get acquainted with your ingredients. Rely on your sense of smell as well! Do not always rely on your sense of sight. Just because some produce look the same as each other does not mean that they necessarily taste the same! I taste my ingredients before I prepare a recipe. I taste them as I cook them, and I of course taste the final product, which is the dish itself. Hell, I taste the different oils, dressings, and vinigarettes I come across at work just so that I can tell the difference between them. To some degree, my research into food microbiology has enabled me to predict flavors based on the pigmentation of the produce. I already know how seared chicken breasts are going to taste when I place crushed garlic along with thinly sliced habanero peppers on top of it as it cooks.<br>

			As the maillard reaction occurs in the chicken, the fat melts and the meat becomes more tender. Exposing the habanero and the crushed garlic to heat causes the molecules to break down. As the molecules break down and separate, the juices literally escape the body of the two veggies. Placing them on top of the chicken while it is searing will cause the chicken to absorb these juices. The maillard reaction is when meats turn brown due to exposure to high temperatures. The crisp brown texture of the chicken in the image serves as a good example. Different types of cooking can effect the way the texture of the meat changes. As you can see, I placed the habanero peppers and garlic on the side of the chicken that was already cooked. I did not to get the chance to take a picture of when I placed the habanero and garlic on the raw side of the chicken, which is the side that is searing in the image. When I look at the image, I realize that it would have been better to place the habanero and garlic beneath the chicken rather than on top. It would have been better to marinate the chicken, and to use these two veggies as an ingredient. I had cooked steak the next day and prepared a cilantro marinade for it. It was very delicious and I was able to make a very interesting observation which I will share in my next post. Moving on, The chicken breast had to cook at a very specific temperature. If it were cooked too low, some parts of the chicken would still be pink, too much, and it'll just be too damn dry. I cooked the chicken breast to a temperature of 155 degrees farenheit. At this temp it remained juicy and tender. The flavors of the habanero and garlic were beautifully absorbed by the chicken as well. I had added sliced pieces of lemon after the chicken was fully cooked and had let it sit for a few minutes before consumption. It would also be good to mention the fact that the chicken breast is a tissue that is not very locomotive as opposed to thighs or wings. The tenderness that we see in chicken breast is due to this fact. Chicken wings are much less tender, and can be cooked at a higher temperature for great flavor and mouthfeel.
