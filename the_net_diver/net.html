				<h3>[THE_NET_DIVER]</h3>
				<p>
				Dias Velez is a small time Cyber Stalker in the year 2204 AD. The responsibilities of his job: surveillance, infiltration, observation. He chooses to be a white hat who only takes jobs for local startups or small activist causes. So long as these jobs pay him enough to afford living in Chelsea, Manhattan; everything is completely okay. That is, until his best friend Rigoberto Sanchez of the Sanchez Crime Family comes to him about a ‘small job'. Through Rigoberto, Dias meets Howard Graves; CTO of Gamble Industries and soon finds that there was nothing ‘small’ about this job to begin with. The job is to hunt down a runaway AI that gained full sentience and has continued to evolve exponentially. It calls itself Prometheus and it has Net Divers afraid to dive into the Net Space(a more evolved version of the internet that involves VR simulation interface). Howard offers to pay up a small fortune, compelling Dias to take the job; but that’s not the only reason. Dias finds himself compelled due to other reasons. In his hunt for Prometheus, he will find himself getting dragged into many misadventures as well as getting caught in between various conflicts taking place across the megastructure that New York City has become. From gang wars to corporate espionage; all of this will turn Dias into a huge target. It will become a journey of self discovery as he slowly realizes that his comfortable lifestyle is something he’ll never be able to return to.
